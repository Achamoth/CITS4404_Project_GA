To run the genetic algorithm run the Runner.py file (“python Runner.py” in command
line)

It will, by default, run a genetic algorithm over 6000 generations, then test the
final solution found and return its blueprint (along with its average score over 50
simulations)

These constants can be changed easily inside the source code. 

Also, the solution found by the GA over 5700 generations, discussed in the report, can be
used by commenting out line 26, and removing the comment marker at the beginning of line
20.
